			<p>This sword hums an almost imperceptible tune when wielded that only its user can hear. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic sword. As a bonus action, you can make the banshee blade either sing or shriek.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When the banshee blade sings, you select up to four creatures you can see, which can include yourself. The selected creatures add a +1 to their attack rolls when they are within 10 feet of the banshee blade.</li>
				<li>When the banshee blade shrieks, you select up to four creatures you can see. The selected creatures subtract a -1 to their attack rolls when they are within 10 feet of the banshee blade.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">While the banshee blade is singing or shrieking, you have disadvantage on stealth checks. The banshee blade sings or shrieks for 4 turns. Once the banshee blade has sung or shrieked, it can’t do so again until you finish a short rest.</p>
