				<p class="flavor">“There is nothing more divine than creation, and clerics of this domain are given what they consider with the manifestation of the most holy of gifts. Creation clerics are known for their ability to manifest objects, structures, and even living beings out of thin air. They channel the divine energy that grants them power and solidify it into tangible form. These clerics worship deities that are at the center of origin stories, or are known for creating worlds, great works, and even peoples.</p>
				<p class="flavor">The mission of a creation cleric varies as much as their creations. Some decide to continue on the work of their god, raising structures in their image and following the rules that their god dictated for their creations. Some task themselves with protecting their god’s divine creations, repairing and preserving their beauty and worth.</p>
				<p class="flavor">There are however creation clerics that believe that they were given the gift of creation to shape the world around them as they see fit, bending it and adding to it as if it was made of clay to twist it into what they believe the world ought to look like. Whether these clerics leave behind a better or worse version of the world they inhabit depends on the cleric’s own divine vision.”</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>The Cleric Divine Domain of Creation is a cleric subclass that focuses on a cleric playstyle that emphasizes set up and upkeep, as well as clever, outside of the box thinking.</p>
			<p class="indent">Their envoy ability allows them to set up ongoing damage, healing, and protection on the battlefield, freeing the cleric’s own actions to do as they see fit. They’ve been given abilities that boost their initiative to make this set up process easier and quick during battle, maximizing the utility of their costly abilities. This set up process relies heavily on their use of Channel Divinity, so the creation domain also gives the cleric ways to mitigate this cost. Creation Clerics get a sort of “ultimate” ability in the summoning of an exalted envoy, an extremely powerful but short-lived ability that allows you to command a large and powerful construct of your own creation.</p>
			<p class="indent">The second pillar of this subclass comes in the shape of the creation cleric’s ability to create walls. This was designed as an extremely open-ended ability that starts out as versatile but only grows in power and versatility as the cleric becomes stronger. To fully capitalize on its power the player must challenge themselves to think on new and creative uses for their walls, using them in new and unique ways. Walls could be used as cover, as obstacles, as ways to traverse spaces, or as a way to separate enemies from their allies, as well as an innumerable number of other uses that the cleric must think of on their own.</p>
			<p class="indent">Players that enjoy coming up with creative uses for their abilities as well as a busier style of gameplay will particularly enjoy this subclass for clerics.</p>

			<p>Starting when you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the ability to harness the power of divine creation. When you prepare your spells, you also choose if you wish to be able to create food, an object, a shield, or a set of tools. As an action, you are able to produce a maximum of 10 pounds of the food or drink of your choice, a non-magical object worth less than 5 gold pieces, or any simple weapon, shield, or set of tools. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. The food or object you created using this feature disappears into thin air at the end of your next long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, you learn the Mending cantrip, which doesn’t count against the number of cleric cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 30 feet and you can cast it as an action.</p>

			<p>Also at 1st level, your eyes see past the existing world before you and into the possibilities that the gift of creation opens to you. As an action, you can consume a spell slot to create a 1/2 foot thick wall in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. The wall is made of stone, such as granite or marble, but you decide the appearance of the wall itself. The length and width of the wall depends on the spell slot level consumed to create it: 10 foot in width or length per spell slot level. For example, if you consume a level 4 spell slot, you can create a 10 foot tall, 40 foot wide wall, or a 40 foot tall, 10 foot wide wall, or a 20 foot tall, 20 foot wide wall, your choice. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface.</p>
			<p class="indent">The wall's AC is 10 and its HP is 20. It’s immune to poison and psychic damage and has resistance against slashing damage. Each 10 foot section of the wall has its own HP. If one section is destroyed, the others stay in place. The wall lasts for 1 hour, after which it disappears into thin air.</p>
			<p class="indent">You also gain an additional bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p>
