			<p class="flavor">A humanoid shape stands before you. Its elongated arms and hunched back cut a truly uncanny silhouette. The creature has mop of long, dishevelled hair and skin with a greenish tint. It grips a weapon fashioned of wood and bone, ready for anything.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bastard Sons.</em></strong> Hags are known to propagate their species in truly grotesque ways. The most common way for a hag to beget another of its kind is by making a dark bargain with a humanoid mortal, offering something they want in exchange for their offspring. Once they have their clutches on the baby, they consume it, and later give birth to a daughter who will grow up to become a hag of the same variety as their mother. In some cases a hag, often disguised with magic, will find a suitable humanoid partner to father their young. In either case the offspring is almost always female, however, on extremely rare occasion a hag may give birth to a male child. Such children will not grow up to be hags, but rather mature as hagspwan.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cruelty of Crones.</em></strong> Hagspawn are often abandoned and discarded by their mothers, and rejected by their fathers (assuming they still live). They are marked with many of the telltale features attributed to hags, but lack their innate magical powers. Left to their own devices, or in some rare cases the mercy of kind strangers, hagspawn are typically destined to carve their own path in life. As sentient creatures with thoughts and feelings, one individual can vary widely from the next. Some hagspawn give in to despair and allow the cruel circumstances of their birth to guide them down a path of solitude. Such individuals can be found living lonesome lives as outlanders, or in some cases leading bands of brigands that respect them for their unnatural strength and iron will. Others reject the cruelty of the world and choose to tread the path of the righteous and well-meaning, occasionally even taking oaths akin to that of a paladin in order to grant them strength in their fight against evil. Such individuals are a force to be reckoned with and potentially powerful allies to the just.</p>

			<h4>Hagspawn as Characters</h4>
			<p>Hagspawn characters may have a variety of different abilities depending on the type of hag who mothered them. There are five subraces of hagspawn found throughout the worlds of D&amp;D: Annis, Bheur, Green, Night, and Sea. Choose one of these subraces.</p>
			<p class="indent">A hagspawn character has certain traits in common with all other hagspawn species.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Lupins are roughly the same size as humans, but tend toward a sturdy build. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Your hag ancestry grants you perfect vision in the dark.  You can see in dim light and darkness within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Survivalist.</em></strong> You gain proficiency in the Survival skill.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Crushing Grip.</em></strong> Like your mother, you have an iron grip capable of crushing anyone you can get your hands on. You have advantage on Athletics (Strength) checks made to grapple another creature. At the end of your turn, you may cause any creature you are grappling to take 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Dexterity increases by 2 and your Charisma is reduced by 2.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Amphibious.</em></strong> You can breathe air and water.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Horrific Visage.</em></strong> You can channel the feywild magic in your veins to truly accentuate your most uncanny features. As an action, you can use this trait to force all creatures of your choice within 30 feet that can see you to make a Wisdom saving throw opposed by your Charisma (Intimidation) check. When you make this check, any negative modifiers to your Charisma should be treated as positive when determining the check’s result. Any creatures that fail this saving throw are frightened of you for 1 minute. Frightened creatures may attempt a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the frightened condition on themselves with a DC equal to whatever your original Charisma (Intimidation) check was. You regain the use of this trait after taking a long rest.</p>
