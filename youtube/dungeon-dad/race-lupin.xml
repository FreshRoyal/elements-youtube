		<description>
			<p>Not much is known to outsiders of the mysterious lupin people. Built like humans with the head of a dog, many creatures mistake lupins for gnolls or werewolves from a distance. A short coat of fur covers a lupin from head to toe, while longer silkier hair grows from the top of their heads. A lupins’ body fur tends to be monochromatic, ranging from light grey through all the shades of brown, to black, with occasional variations.</p>
			<h4>Lupin Features</h4>
			<p class="indent" style="margin-top:15px"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a Beast and a Humanoid.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Lupins mature at about the same rate as humans, except that they reach adulthood in their early teens. They typically live to an age between 80 and 100 years.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Lupins are roughly the same size as humans, but tend toward a sturdy build. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Their strong belief in community, loyalty, and trust mark lupins as highly lawful creatures. Generosity and pity for those less fortunate also define many of the lupin cultural values, however, they are known to hold grudges and and often refuse to aid those who have wronged them in the past. Most lupins tend to be lawful good or lawful neutral, though there are always exceptions.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Lupine Senses.</em></strong> Whenever you make an ability check that relies on hearing or smell, you are considered proficient with the skill. You have advantage on any ability check you make to track a creature or object.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> Your jaws are a natural weapon that you can use to make melee attacks. On a hit your bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Fierce Loyalty.</em></strong> When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make the attack target you instead.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, Lupin, and one other language of your choice.</p>
